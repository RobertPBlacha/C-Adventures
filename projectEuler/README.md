# Project Euler
##  About
This is where I keep the solutions to project euler questions. My code is written in C and for most of the new solutions I post you can find writeups alongside working c programs.
## Highlights
### Hardest Solve
[Problem #155](https://github.com/RobertPBlacha/C-Adventures/tree/main/projectEuler/Problem155), counting the number of possible capacitors you can construct with $n$ capacitors of equal capacitance. This was a 60% difficulty problem and involved efficiently combining rationals
### Favorites

 - [Problem 162](https://github.com/RobertPBlacha/C-Adventures/tree/main/projectEuler/Problem162), how many hexadecimal numbers that have certain digits, 45% difficulty
	 - Bonus: Flowcharts in a README
- [Problem 146](https://github.com/RobertPBlacha/C-Adventures/tree/main/projectEuler/Problem146), finding patterns in consecutive primes, 50% difficulty
- Problems [173](https://github.com/RobertPBlacha/C-Adventures/tree/main/projectEuler/Problem173) and [174](https://github.com/RobertPBlacha/C-Adventures/tree/main/projectEuler/Problem174), investigating constructions of certain shapes, 30% and 40% difficulty respectively
	- Both revolve around the same setup
